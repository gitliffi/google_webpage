Goal: Build Google.com's search result

Thoughts: Pre-project
After finishing the simpler google homepage, I thought I would try the search result page which seems much more complex. I feel that I didn't really utilise CSS' flexbox and grid to its fullest extent in the previous project. Snippets of code for the searchform as well as the footer can most probably be used for this project. I think learning to make a fixed searchform that scrolls with the page would be interesting as well as using the grid to organise the webpage results.

Thoughts: Post-Project
Okay, this project clearly did not go as planned. I would say I have learned to be a little more comfortable using CSS now and dividing items into containers using html. I did not create a sticky header as I realised I needed some JavaScript for that. Didn't use a grid for my results page as I realised setting line heights, paddings and a min-width would solve the issue and was much less of a hassle. I still have some trouble with some of the icons and their positions, as well as adding the blue bar to the selected icon in the navbar sections but Id rather move on to other projects than to be stuck on this one for too long.
